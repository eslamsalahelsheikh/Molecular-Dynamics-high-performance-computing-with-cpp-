  % you can also set it to full for even more space. But there is a bad tex style decision: parskip also changes the spacing between listitems such as
  % enumerate and itemize. For this purpose we include the enumitem package and set itemsep=.5em, of course you can change this

  % oneside,

  % Remember to change order in the babel package (below) as well.
  % Last language is the preferred one.
